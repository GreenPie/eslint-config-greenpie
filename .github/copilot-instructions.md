# Commit message instructions

Begin the commit message with a single short (no more than 50 characters) "Conventional Commits"-like line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description in list format with fun emoji per each item that represents the change.

Do not break down the details of the changes deeply, no need to explain every changed line in details.

Put emoji on the beginning of the text following the format: "-{one space}{emoji}{one space}{text}".
